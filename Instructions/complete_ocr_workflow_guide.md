# Complete OCR Processing and Knowledge Organization Workflow

## Phase 1: Initial Setup and Text Extraction

### 1.1 Repository Setup
1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., "OCR-Tests")
2. Create the following directory structure:
   ```
   OCR-Tests/
   ├── images/
   ├── Extracted text/
   ├── Stage 1 processing/
   ├── Stage 2 processing/
   ├── Palace item breakdowns/
   └── Instructions/
   ```

### 1.2 Text Extraction Process
1. When providing an image to Claude, request:
   - ALL text content
   - All headers and subheaders
   - Body text
   - Figure labels and captions
   - Diagram annotations
   - Special characters and mathematical notation

2. Verification step:
   - Compare extracted text with original image
   - Create comparison table for any missed content
   - Update extracted text file with complete content

3. File storage:
   - Save raw extracted text in "Extracted text" folder
   - Use clear file naming (e.g., "cell_structure_text.txt")

## Phase 2: Initial Content Organization

### 2.1 Concept Identification
1. Identify main concepts from the text
2. Create headings for each major concept
3. List relevant facts under each concept as bullet points
4. Include all information from original text
5. Store in "Stage 1 processing" folder

### 2.2 Organization Guidelines
- Group related information under appropriate concepts
- Maintain hierarchical structure with main concepts and subconcepts
- Include all technical details and specifications
- Preserve special characters and notations
- Use markdown formatting for clarity

## Phase 3: Content Condensation

### 3.1 Condensation Process
1. Review each bullet point for possible combinations
2. Combine related points while maintaining clarity
3. Guidelines for condensation:
   - Merge sequential or related facts
   - Combine repeated information
   - Maintain technical accuracy
   - Keep essential details
4. Store in "Stage 2 processing" folder

### 3.2 Example Condensation:
Original:
```
* Developed in the mid-17th century
* Development has continued since then
* Still widely used to look at cells
```
Condensed:
```
* Initially developed mid-17th century, still widely used today
```

## Phase 4: Memory Palace Item Creation

### 4.1 Basic Item Structure
1. Add main concept emoji and physical representation:
```
## Light Microscope 🔬 [An actual light microscope]
```

2. Add individual fact emoji and items:
```
* ⏳ Fact goes here
[Physical item 1]
[Physical item 2]
[Physical item 3]
```

### 4.2 Link Suggestion Implementation
1. Identify related facts that can be linked together
2. Add {Link Suggestion} marker before related group
3. Break down each component of the link:
   ```
   {Link Suggestion: Light Microscope Advantages}
   * 💰 Cost Advantage: Relatively cheap
   [Item 1]
   [Item 2]
   [Item 3]

   * 📦 Portability Advantage: Can be used anywhere
   [Item 1]
   [Item 2]
   [Item 3]
   ```

### 4.3 Guidelines for Physical Items
1. Must be concrete, tangible objects
2. Should be easily visualizable
3. Should relate directly to the concept
4. Can range from simple to complex
5. Should be memorable and distinct

## Best Practices Throughout Process

### 1. File Management
- Use clear, descriptive file names
- Maintain consistent folder structure
- Keep regular commits with meaningful messages
- Update instructions as workflow evolves

### 2. Content Organization
- Maintain consistent formatting
- Use proper markdown syntax
- Include all necessary special characters
- Preserve technical accuracy

### 3. Quality Control
- Regular comparison with source material
- Verification of complete information transfer
- Check for technical accuracy in condensed versions
- Ensure physical items are concrete and relevant

### 4. Memory Palace Considerations
- Choose distinct emojis for each concept
- Ensure physical items are tangible and memorable
- Create logical links between related concepts
- Provide multiple options for representation
