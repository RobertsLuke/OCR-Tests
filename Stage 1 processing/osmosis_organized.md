# Osmosis and Cell Transport

## Diffusion Basics
* Particles spread from high to low concentration
* Requirements:
  - Particles must be soluble
  - Particles must be small enough to pass through membrane
* Occurs through partially permeable membranes
* Cell membrane controls particle passage

## Partially Permeable Membranes
* Only allow certain particles through
* Cell membranes are partially permeable
* Selective passage of substances
* Key role in cellular control

## Solution Concentrations
* Dilute Solution:
  - High water concentration (solvent)
  - Low sugar concentration (solute)

* Concentrated Solution:
  - Low water concentration
  - High sugar concentration

## Osmosis Definition and Process
* Special type of diffusion
* Only water molecules move
* Movement through partially permeable membrane
* Direction: dilute to concentrated solution
* Driven by solute concentration differences

## Cell Cytoplasm Characteristics
* Contains chemicals dissolved in water
* Inside partially permeable membrane
* Fairly concentrated solution of:
  - Salts
  - Sugars
* Concentration must remain stable

## Experimental Model
* Uses partially permeable membrane bags
* Demonstrates osmosis in action
* Two scenarios:
  1. Hypotonic solution:
     - Water moves into bag
     - Level rises in tube
  2. Hypertonic solution:
     - Water moves out of bag
     - Level falls in tube

## Diagram Components
* Equipment:
  - Glass tube
  - Membrane bag
  - Sugar solution
  - Water

* Measurements:
  - Initial level
  - Final level
  - Water movement direction

## Biological Importance
* Critical for cell function
* Maintains proper solute concentrations
* Internal environment regulation
* Cell volume control
