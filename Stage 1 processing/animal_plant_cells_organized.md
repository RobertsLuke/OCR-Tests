# Animal and Plant Cells: Organized Concepts

## Animal Cell Structure
* Size range: 10-30 μm long
* Scale perspective: 100000-300000 cells would line up along 1 meter
* Human cells are typical animal cells

### Core Components
* Nucleus
  - Controls all cell activities
  - Surrounded by nuclear membrane
  - Contains genes on chromosomes
  - Contains instructions for protein production
  - Average diameter: 10 μm

* Cytoplasm
  - Liquid gel consistency
  - Contains suspended organelles
  - Site of most chemical reactions

* Cell Membrane
  - Controls substance passage into cell (glucose, minerals)
  - Regulates movement out of cell (urea, hormones)

* Mitochondria
  - Location: in cytoplasm
  - Function: aerobic respiration site
  - Size: 1-2 μm length, 0.2-0.7 μm diameter
  - Purpose: energy release for cell

* Ribosomes
  - Function: protein synthesis site
  - Produces all needed cellular proteins

## Plant Cell Structure
* Size range: 10-100 μm in length
* Larger than animal cells
* Contains all animal cell features plus additional structures

### Additional Plant Features
* Cell Wall
  - Made of cellulose
  - Provides strength and support
  - Present in all plant and algal cells

* Chloroplasts
  - Location: all green plant parts
  - Contains chlorophyll (green pigment)
  - Size: 3-5 μm long
  - Function: photosynthesis
  - Not present in root cells (underground location)

* Permanent Vacuole
  - Space in cytoplasm
  - Contains cell sap
  - Function: maintains cell rigidity
  - Provides plant support

## Algal Cells
* Classification: now in protista kingdom
* Previously classified as plants
* Features:
  - Contain nucleus and chloroplasts
  - Can photosynthesize
  - Have cellulose cell wall
  - Similar to plant cells

## Practical Microscopy
* Observable features:
  - Animal cells: basic structures visible
  - Plant cells: cell wall, cytoplasm, vacuole visible
  - Elodea: shows chloroplasts
  - Onion cells: no chloroplasts (non-photosynthetic)

### Important Notes
* Scale magnification must be shown on drawings
* Safety procedures for cheek cell preparation
* Not all plant cells contain chloroplasts
* Distinguish between chloroplasts and chlorophyll

## Advanced Cell Structures
* Ultrastructure includes:
  - Cytoskeleton
  - Golgi apparatus
  - Rough endoplasmic reticulum
  - Smooth endoplasmic reticulum
* Functions:
  - Cell support and movement
  - Protein and lipid modification
  - Chemical production for body function

## Assessment Focus
* Main structures identification
* Plant vs animal cell differences
* Structure function relationships
* Importance of nucleus and mitochondria
* Distribution of chloroplasts
* Practical microscopy skills
