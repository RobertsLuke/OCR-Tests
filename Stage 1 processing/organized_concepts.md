# Organized Concepts from Cell Structure Text

## Microscopy Units
* 1 kilometre (km) = 1000 metres (m)
* 1 m = 100 centimetres (cm)
* 1 cm = 10 millimetres (mm)
* 1 mm = 1000 micrometres (μm)
* 1 μm = 1000 nanometres (nm)
* A nanometre is 0.000000001 metres
* Can be written in standard form as 1 × 10⁻⁹ m

## Light Microscope
* Developed in the mid-17th century
* Development has continued since then
* Still widely used to look at cells
* Uses a beam of light to form an image
* Can magnify around 2000 times (×2000)
* School microscopes usually only magnify several hundred times
* Relatively cheap
* Can be used almost anywhere
* Can magnify live specimens

### Light Microscope Components
* Eyepiece
* Objective lens
* Stage
* Coarse focus
* Fine focus
* Slide
* Light

## Electron Microscope
* Invented in the 1930s
* Allowed biologists to see subcellular structures inside cells
* Uses a beam of electrons to form an image
* Can magnify objects up to around 2,000,000 times
* Must be kept in special conditions:
  - Temperature controlled rooms
  - Pressure controlled rooms
  - Humidity controlled rooms
* Large in size
* Very expensive

### Types of Electron Microscopes
1. Transmission Electron Microscopes:
   * Give 2D images
   * Very high magnification
   * High resolution

2. Scanning Electron Microscopes:
   * Give dramatic 3D images
   * Lower magnifications than transmission type

## Calculating Magnification
* Multiply eyepiece lens magnification by objective lens magnification
* Example: Eyepiece lens ×4 × objective lens ×10 = ×40 total magnification
* When labeling drawings:
  - Must clearly state the magnification used
  - Should indicate "as viewed at [magnification]" (e.g., as viewed at ×40)

## General Cell Facts
* All living things are made up of cells
* Most cells are so small they can only be seen using a microscope
* Understanding measurement units is important before examining tiny specimens
