# Cell Structure and Microscopy - Stage 1 Processing

## Microscopy Basics
* Living things are all made up of cells, but most cells are so small you can only see them using a microscope
* It is important to grasp the units used for such tiny specimens before you start to look at them

## Units of Measurement
* 1 kilometre (km) = 1000 metres (m)
* 1 m = 100 centimetres (cm)
* 1 cm = 10 millimetres (mm)
* 1 mm = 1000 micrometres (μm)
* 1 μm = 1000 nanometres (nm)
* A nanometre is 0.000 000 001 metres (or written in standard form as 1 × 10⁻⁹ m)

## Light Microscopes
* The first light microscopes were developed in the mid-17th century
* Their development has continued ever since and they are still widely used to look at cells
* Light microscopes use a beam of light to form an image of an object
* The best light microscopes can magnify around 2000 times (×2000)
* School microscopes usually only magnify several hundred times
* Light microscopes are relatively cheap
* Light microscopes can be used almost anywhere
* Light microscopes can magnify live specimens
* Light microscopes have a resolving power of about 200 nm

## Electron Microscopes
* The invention of the electron microscope occurred in the 1930s
* Electron microscopes allowed biologists to see and understand more about the subcellular structures inside cells
* Electron microscopes use a beam of electrons to form an image
* Electron microscopes can magnify objects up to around 2,000,000 times
* There are two main types: transmission and scanning electron microscopes
* Transmission electron microscopes give 2D images with very high magnification and resolution
* Scanning electron microscopes give dramatic 3D images but lower magnifications
* Electron microscopes are large and very expensive
* Electron microscopes have to be kept in special temperature, pressure, and humidity-controlled rooms
* Scanning electron microscopes have a resolving power of about 10 nm
* Transmission electron microscopes have a resolving power of about 0.2 nm (approximately the distance apart of two atoms in a solid substance)

## Calculating Magnification
* For light microscopes: multiply the magnification of the eyepiece lens by the magnification of the objective lens
* Example: If eyepiece lens is ×4 and objective lens is ×10, overall magnification is: 4 × 10 = ×40
* When labeling drawings, make it clear that the magnification you give is the magnification at which you looked at the specimen

## Calculating Object Size
* Based on the magnification triangle showing relationship between image size, magnification, and size of real object
* Formula: magnification = size of image / size of real object
* Rearranged: size of real object = size of image / magnification
* Example: At magnification ×40, if image measures 1 mm, then size of real object = 1/40 mm = 0.025 mm or 25 μm

## Resolving Power
* Resolution is the ability to distinguish between two separate points
* Resolving power affects how much detail a microscope can show
* Minimum distance between two objects when you can see them clearly as separate
* If objects are closer together than the resolving power, they appear as one object
* Light microscope has a resolving power of about 200 nm
* Scanning electron microscope has a resolving power of about 10 nm
* Transmission electron microscope has a resolving power of about 0.2 nm

## Practical Applications
* The height of an average person magnified by one of the best light microscopes would look about 3.5 km
* The height of an average person magnified by an electron microscope would look about 3500 km
