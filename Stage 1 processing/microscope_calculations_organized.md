# Microscope Calculations and Concepts

## Size Calculation
* Formula based on magnification triangle
* magnification = size of image/size of real object
* Can find third factor if two are known
* Example calculation:
  - At magnification ×40
  - Image measures 1 mm
  - Real object = 1/40 mm = 0.025 mm = 25 μm

## Magnification Capabilities
* Light microscopes:
  - Magnify up to about ×2000
  - Can make average person appear 3.5 km tall
  - Resolving power of about 200 nm

* Electron microscopes:
  - Magnify up to about ×2000000
  - Can make average person appear 3500 km tall
  - Types:
    * Scanning electron microscope: 10 nm resolving power
    * Transmission electron microscope: 0.2 nm resolving power (atomic scale)

## Resolution Concept
* Minimum distance needed between objects to see them as separate
* Closer objects appear as one
* Resolution determines detail visibility
* Resolving power varies by microscope type

## Visual Examples
* Figure 2: Onion cells dividing
  - Viewed through light microscope
  - Magnification ×570

* Figure 3: Chromosomes during cell division
  - Viewed with scanning electron microscope
  - Magnification ×4500

## Study Guidelines
* Learn to calculate:
  - Magnification
  - Cell size
  - Image size
* Understand standard form for very small/large numbers
* Reference: Maths skills MS1b
* Cell division details in Chapter B2
