[A 1930s calendar with a breakthrough discovery marked]

* 🔬 Uses electron beams instead of light to form images
[A stream of electron particles flowing through an apparatus]

{Link Suggestion: Types of Electron Microscopes}
* 📄 Transmission type: 2D images with highest magnification (×2,000,000)
[A flat paper with an extremely detailed 2D image]

* 🏔️ Scanning type: Dramatic 3D images with lower magnification
[A 3D mountain model with textured surface]

{Link Suggestion: Electron Microscope Limitations}
* 💸 Cost limitation: Very expensive
[An empty wallet with price tag showing many zeros]

* 🏢 Size limitation: Requires dedicated facility
[A large specialized building housing a single microscope]

* 🌡️ Environment limitation: Needs controlled temperature, pressure, and humidity
[A room with multiple gauges and environmental controls]

{Link Suggestion: Resolving Power Comparison}
* 👁️ Incredible resolving power: 10 nm (scanning) to 0.2 nm (transmission)

## Calculating Magnification ✖️ [An oversized calculator with multiplication button highlighted]

* 🧮 Light microscope formula: eyepiece magnification × objective magnification
[An abacus with two rows of beads multiplying together]

* 📝 Documentation rule: Always specify the viewing magnification on drawings
[A labeled diagram with "viewed at ×40" clearly marked]

## Calculating Object Size 📉 [A triangle-shaped measuring tool]

{Link Suggestion: Size Calculation Formula}
* 📊 Triangular relationship: magnification = image size ÷ real object size
[A triangle with these three variables at each corner]

* 🔢 Real object size formula: image size ÷ magnification
[A division problem showing 1 mm ÷ 40 = 0.025 mm (25 μm)]

## Resolving Power 🔍 [Two points merging into one as they get closer together]

{Link Suggestion: Resolution Limits Visualization}
* 👓 Definition: Minimum distance between distinguishable points
[Two dots on a page that merge when placed too close together]

* 📊 Resolution comparison: light microscope (200 nm) → scanning electron microscope (10 nm) → transmission electron microscope (0.2 nm)
[A staircase with three clearly labeled steps of decreasing size]

* ⚛️ Atomic-level perspective: Highest resolution approaches atomic distances
