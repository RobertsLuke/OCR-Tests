# Cell Structure and Microscopy - Stage 2 Processing

## Microscopy Basics
* Cells are microscopic structures that make up all living things, requiring microscopes for observation due to their small size
* Understanding measurement units is essential when working with microscopic specimens

## Units of Measurement
* Hierarchical measurement system: km (10³ m) → m → cm (10⁻² m) → mm (10⁻³ m) → μm (10⁻⁶ m) → nm (10⁻⁹ m)
* A nanometre (nm) equals 0.000 000 001 meters or 1 × 10⁻⁹ m in standard form

## Light Microscopes
* Developed in mid-17th century and continuously improved, light microscopes remain widely used for cell observation
* Use light beams to form images with magnification up to ×2000 (typical school microscopes: several hundred times)
* Advantages: relatively inexpensive, portable, can examine living specimens
* Have a resolving power of about 200 nm

## Electron Microscopes
* Invented in the 1930s, allowing visualization of subcellular structures using electron beams
* Two main types: transmission (2D images, higher magnification) and scanning (3D images, lower magnification)
* Can magnify up to ×2,000,000 with resolving power down to 0.2 nm (atomic-level resolution)
* Limitations: large, expensive, require controlled environments (temperature, pressure, humidity)
* Scanning electron microscopes: ~10 nm resolution; transmission electron microscopes: ~0.2 nm resolution

## Calculating Magnification
* Light microscope magnification = eyepiece lens magnification × objective lens magnification
* Example: ×4 eyepiece with ×10 objective yields ×40 total magnification
* Always specify magnification when labeling microscope images (e.g., "viewed at ×40")

## Calculating Object Size
* Key relationship: magnification = image size ÷ real object size
* To find real object size: image size ÷ magnification
* Example: 1 mm image at ×40 magnification represents an actual size of 25 μm (0.025 mm)

## Resolving Power
* Determines minimum distance between two points that can be distinguished as separate
* Directly affects the level of detail a microscope can reveal
* Comparison: light microscope (200 nm) → scanning electron microscope (10 nm) → transmission electron microscope (0.2 nm)
* The resolving power of transmission electron microscopes approaches the distance between atoms in solids

## Practical Perspective
* An average human magnified by the best light microscopes would appear about 3.5 km tall
* The same person viewed through an electron microscope could appear up to 3500 km tall
