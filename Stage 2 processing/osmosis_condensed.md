# Condensed Osmosis Concepts

## Core Principles
* Diffusion: soluble particle movement high→low concentration
* Osmosis: water-specific diffusion through partially permeable membranes
* Membrane properties: selective passage of specific particles

## Solution Types
* Dilute: high water/low solute concentration
* Concentrated: low water/high solute concentration
* Cytoplasm: balanced solution of dissolved chemicals

## Water Movement
* Direction: dilute→concentrated solution
* Through: partially permeable membrane
* Purpose: concentration balance maintenance

## Practical Demonstration
* Model: membrane bag with glass tube
* Conditions:
  - Hypotonic: water entry, rising level
  - Hypertonic: water exit, falling level

## Biological Significance
* Controls cell volume
* Maintains solute balance
* Essential for cell function
