# Condensed Cell Structure Concepts

## Animal Cell Essentials
* Typical size 10-30 μm (100000-300000 per meter)
* Core components:
  - Nucleus (10 μm): control center containing genetic instructions
  - Cytoplasm: gel-like reaction medium with suspended organelles
  - Cell membrane: selective gateway for substances
  - Mitochondria (1-2 μm × 0.2-0.7 μm): cellular powerhouses
  - Ribosomes: protein production sites

## Plant Cell Specializations
* Larger structure (10-100 μm)
* Contains all animal cell features plus:
  - Cellulose cell wall: structural support
  - Chloroplasts (3-5 μm): photosynthetic units in green tissue
  - Permanent vacuole: maintains rigidity via cell sap

## Algal Characteristics
* Protista kingdom members
* Combines plant-like features (photosynthesis, cell wall) with unique traits
* Specialized aquatic adaptations

## Microscopy Practicalities
* Observable structures vary by cell type
* Magnification must be recorded
* Special safety for human tissue samples
* Key distinction between chloroplasts and chlorophyll

## Advanced Features
* Ultrastructure elements support cell function:
  - Movement and support systems
  - Protein processing
  - Chemical production

## Key Concepts for Assessment
* Structure identification
* Comparative analysis
* Functional relationships
* Practical skills
