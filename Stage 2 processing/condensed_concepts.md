# Condensed Concepts from Cell Structure Text

## Microscopy Units
* Standard unit conversion: 1 km = 1000 m = 100,000 cm = 1,000,000 mm
* Microscopic measurements: 1 mm = 1000 μm = 1,000,000 nm (1 nm = 1 × 10⁻⁹ m)

## Light Microscope
* Initially developed mid-17th century, still widely used today
* Uses light beam technology, achieving magnification up to ×2000 (school versions typically several hundred times)
* Advantages: relatively cheap, portable, and capable of examining live specimens

### Light Microscope Components
* Viewing system: eyepiece and objective lens
* Focus controls: coarse and fine adjustment
* Specimen placement: stage and slide
* Illumination: light source

## Electron Microscope
* 1930s invention enabling subcellular structure visualization
* Uses electron beam technology, achieving magnification up to 2,000,000×
* Environmental requirements: specialized temperature, pressure, and humidity-controlled facilities
* High cost and large size limitations

### Types of Electron Microscopes
* Transmission type: high-resolution 2D imaging with superior magnification
* Scanning type: lower magnification but produces detailed 3D imagery

## Calculating Magnification
* Simple multiplication: eyepiece magnification × objective lens magnification (e.g., ×4 × ×10 = ×40)
* Documentation requirement: specify viewing magnification in drawings (format: "as viewed at ×40")

## General Cell Facts
* Cells form the basis of all living organisms, requiring microscopic observation due to their minute size
* Understanding measurement units is prerequisite to microscopic examination
