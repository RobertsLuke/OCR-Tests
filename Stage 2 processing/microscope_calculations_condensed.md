# Condensed Microscope Concepts

## Size Calculation
* Triangle formula: magnification = image size/real object size
* Calculate any factor when two others are known
* Example: 1 mm image at ×40 = 25 μm real size

## Microscope Capabilities
* Light microscopes: ×2000 max, 200 nm resolution, 3.5 km person equivalent
* Electron microscopes: ×2000000 max, 3500 km person equivalent
  - SEM: 10 nm resolution
  - TEM: 0.2 nm resolution (atomic level)

## Resolution
* Minimum separation distance for distinct object visibility
* Resolution determines microscope's detail capability
* Ranges from 200 nm (light) to 0.2 nm (TEM)

## Visual Applications
* Light microscope: Cell division at ×570 (onion cells)
* SEM: Chromosome visualization at ×4500

## Study Focus
* Master size-magnification-image calculations
* Understand standard form notation
* References: MS1b (math), B2 (cell division)

## Assessment
* Compare microscope advantages/disadvantages
* Calculate sizes and magnifications
* Evaluate microscope applications
